 <h2>Project Name: Employees CRUD Operation in Java </h2>

<h2>Objective:</h2> To create a simple Java Console application to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Employees profiles.

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>

* Java 8<br>
* Java Console for the user interface<br>
* XAMPP server for local host and used to test before publishing remote server<br>
* My SQL for the database<br>

<h2>Steps to follow:</h2>

1. Create the database table for Employees profiles using MySQL.
2. Develop the user interface using Java with the following functionalities:<br>
   * Add a new employee profile<br>
   * View all employees profiles<br>
   * Update existing employees profile<br>
   * Delete employee profile<br>
   * Implement the database connectivity using Java JDBC API.<br>
   * Perform the CRUD operations using MySQL query statements.<br>
   * Test the application by adding, viewing, updating and deleting employees profiles.

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

This project helps to understand the basic CRUD operations in Java using MySQL as the database and Java as the user interface. It provides a simple solution for managing employees profiles in an efficient and user-friendly way.

<h2>JDBC CRUD operations concepts by using the five steps :</h2>
<p> 1. Load/Registering the driver<br>
     2. Establishing the connection<br>
     3. Creating the statement<br>
     4. Executing the statement/query<br>
     5. Closing the connection<br>

 CRUD refers to the four basic operations a software application should be able to
 perform â€“ Create, Read, Update, and Delete. 
 In such apps, users must be able to create data, have access to the data
 in the UI by reading the data, update or edit the data, and delete the data.
